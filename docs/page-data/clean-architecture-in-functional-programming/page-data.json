This solution works well with web applications, where a call goes back and forth, and for each URI call, a service can be broken into different domains and hosted as separate services. The idea is to do one domain at a time. This creates two separate applications that live side by side in the same URI space. Eventually, the newly refactored application \\u201Cstrangles\\u201D or replaces the original application until finally, you can shut off the monolithic application.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Apart from strangler, an anti-corruption layer implements a facade between new and legacy applications, to ensure that the design of a new application is not limited by dependencies on legacy systems.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Law of implementation patterns\")), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"span\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\",\n    \"style\": {\n      \"position\": \"relative\",\n      \"display\": \"block\",\n      \"marginLeft\": \"auto\",\n      \"marginRight\": \"auto\",\n      \"maxWidth\": \"991px\"\n    }\n  }), \"\\n      \", mdx(\"span\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"span\"\n  }, {\n    \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\",\n    \"style\": {\n      \"paddingBottom\": \"70.33299697275478%\",\n      \"position\": \"relative\",\n      \"bottom\": \"0\",\n      \"left\": \"0\",\n      \"backgroundImage\": \"url('data:image/png;base64,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')\",\n      \"backgroundSize\": \"cover\",\n      \"display\": \"block\"\n    }\n  })), \"\\n  \", mdx(\"picture\", {\n    parentName: \"span\"\n  }, \"\\n        \", mdx(\"source\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"picture\"\n  }, {\n    \"srcSet\": [\"/static/79ac331adc47053b80ac4ed091f7e727/6116d/microservice2.webp 991w\"],\n    \"sizes\": \"(max-width: 991px) 100vw, 991px\",\n    \"type\": \"image/webp\"\n  })), \"\\n        \", mdx(\"source\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"picture\"\n  }, {\n    \"srcSet\": [\"/static/79ac331adc47053b80ac4ed091f7e727/d3d79/microservice2.png 991w\"],\n    \"sizes\": \"(max-width: 991px) 100vw, 991px\",\n    \"type\": \"image/png\"\n  })), \"\\n        \", mdx(\"img\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"picture\"\n  }, {\n    \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-image\",\n    \"src\": \"/static/79ac331adc47053b80ac4ed091f7e727/d3d79/microservice2.png\",\n    \"alt\": \"Image Source : Microsoft blog\",\n    \"title\": \"Image Source : Microsoft blog\",\n    \"loading\": \"lazy\",\n    \"style\": {\n      \"width\": \"100%\",\n      \"height\": \"100%\",\n      \"margin\": \"0\",\n      \"verticalAlign\": \"middle\",\n      \"position\": \"absolute\",\n      \"top\": \"0\",\n      \"left\": \"0\"\n    }\n  })), \"\\n      \"), \"\\n    \")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The eight core widely used microservices are that every architect shall know for high-performance systems includes\"), mdx(\"ul\", null, mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"Ambassador can be used to offload common client connectivity tasks such as monitoring, logging, routing, and security \", \"(\", \"such as TLS\", \")\", \" in a language agnostic way.\"), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"Anti-corruption layer implements a facade between new and legacy applications, to ensure that the design of a new application is not limited by dependencies on legacy systems.\"), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"Backends for Frontends creates separate backend services for different types of clients, such as desktop and mobile.
