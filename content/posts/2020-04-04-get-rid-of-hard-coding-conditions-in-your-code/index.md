State Machine simulation is one of the most common practices. It is not a coding-oriented design pattern, but it is system-oriented, often used to model cases for the business use. Using F\# and domain driven design, we can not only define different types to represent the state, but we can also define behaviour as functions for various state transition rules.

For example, given a current state X, a state machine will define what new state X can change to, and what events can cause the state changes to occur. i.e. Current State -&gt; Event -&gt; New State

In our scenario, we have various states and transition events of a process in an operating system viz.

```text
module Process
    module StateMachine
        type ProcessState =
            | New
            | Ready
            | Running
            | Waiting
            | Terminated
        
        type ProcessEvent
            | Admit
            | Interrupt
            | SchedulerDispatch
            | IOEventWait
            | IOEventCompletion
            | Exit
```

Let us create a state machine function that can provide the transition based on current state and event. It will be a simple pattern matching to identify the new state.

```text
let stateMachine (state, event) =
    match state, event with
    | New, Admit
        -> Ready
    | Ready, SchedulerDispatch
        -> Running
    | Running, IOEventWait
        -> Waiting
    | Running, Exit
        -> Terminated
    | Running, Interrupt
        -> Ready
    | Waiting, IOEventCompletion
        -> Ready
    | _
        -> failwith  "Invalid Transition"
```

The above function can provide the behaviour for transition, but it has an issue, it will allow us to raise an event which might not be permitted by the state such as ADMIT event when the current state is WAITING. This can lead to a run time exception "Invalid Transition". Thus a better way to provide the implementation for the above code is to replace with the following code. First, we create two helper function, stateTransition that will take event as an input to return the future state and getEventForState that will take the current state as an input to return the collection of possible events it can raise.

```text
let private stateTransition event =
    match event with
    | Admit
        -> Ready
    | SchedulerDispatch
        -> Running
    | IOEventWait
        -> Waiting
    | Exit
        -> Terminated
    | Interrupt
        -> Ready
    | IOEventCompletion
        -> ready
        
let private getEventForState state =
    match state with
    | New
        ->[|Admit|]
    | Ready
        -> [|SchedulerDispatch|]
    | Running
        -> [|IOEventWait, Interrupt, Exit|]
    | Waiting
        -> [|IOEventCompletion|]
```

Now we need a circular reference type that can be used to store the allowed event record with an identification property and a method function that takes a unit as an input to returns future allowed events with current state details.

```text
type AllowedEvent = 
        {
                EventInfo : ProcessEvent
                RaiseEvent : unit -> EventResult
        }
and EventResult
        {
                CurrentState : ProcessState
                AllowedEvents : AllowedEvent array
        }
```

In the above definition, AllowedEvent references EventResult in RaiseEvent and EventResult references AllowedEvent in AllowedEvents. Please note that both functions stateTransition and getEventForState are private to module.

Let us implement the final state machine function

```text
let rec stateMachine event =
    let newState = stateTransition event
    let newEvents = getEventForState newState
    {
        CurrentState = newState
        AllowedEvents = 
            newEvents
            |> Array.map (fun e ->
                let f() = stateMachine e
                {
                    EventInfo = e
                    RaiseEvent = f
                })
    }
```

This is recursive function as it is self referencing and it returns EventResult type. The stateMachine function takes the event as an input to calculate newState and newEvent using helper methods and then creates EventResult. The AllowedEvent array create a special map of functions, to be called at runtime for transitioning between states from outside the module. By implementing above code we can utilise the result from each RaiseEvent to traverse further.

To complete the the above implementation we would provide a method to be accessed publicly and it will give us initial result of the state machine.

```text
let init() = stateMachine New
```

To test the implementation, we can now proceed as

```text
let result = init()
let result1 = result.AllowedEvents.[0].raiseEvent()
```

This methodology ensures that every time we raise an event, it is a valid event.
