Software designers talk about design patterns or the best practices for application designing. The choice is between which mistake is easier to correct: under-doing it or overdoing it.

We keep on adding ingredients to the curry and food is left with no taste. Let’s explore some anti-patterns and explore the pitfalls of Software designing.

**Organisational anti-patterns**

* Analysis paralysis - Devoting disproportionate effort to the analysis phase of the project.
* Cash cow - A profitable legacy product that often leads to complacency about new product.
* Design by committee - The result of having many contributors to a design - but no unifying vision.
* Moral hazard - Insulating a decision-maker from the consequences of his or her decision.
* Stovepipe or Silos - A structure that supports mostly up-down flow of data but inhibits cross organisational communication.
* Vendor lock-in - Making a system extensively dependent on an external supplied component.

**Design anti-patterns**

* Abstraction inversion - Not exposing implemented functionality required by user, so that they reimplement it using higher level functions.
* Ambiguous viewpoint - Presenting a model \(OOAD\) without specifying its viewpoint.
* Big ball of mud - A system with no recognisable structure.
* Database as IPC - Using DB as message queue for inter-process communication where a more lightweight mechanism would be suitable.
* Gold plating - Continuing to work on a project well past the point at which extra effort is not adding value.
* Inner - platform effect - A software so customisable as to become poor replica of software development platform.
* Input kludge - Failing to specify and implement handling of possibly invalid inputs.
* Interface bloat - making an interface so powerful that it is extremely difficult to implement.
* Magic push button - Coding implementation logic directly within interface code, without using abstraction.
* Race hazard - Failing to see consequences of different orders of events.
* Stovepipe system - A barely maintainable assemblage of ill-related components.

**OOD anti-patterns**

* Anaemic domain model - Use of domain model without business knowledge.
* Base bean - Inheriting functionality from utility class rather than delegating to it.
* Call super - Requiring subclasses to call a superclass’s overridden method.
* Circle ellipse problem - Sub typing variable-types on the bases of value-subtypes.
* Circular dependency - Introducing unnecessary direct or indirect mutual dependencies between objects.
* Constant interface - using interface to define constants.
* God object - Concentrating too many functionalities in a single part of design.
* Object cesspool - Reusing objects whose state does not confirm to the contract of reuse.
* Object orgy - Failing to properly encapsulate objects permitting unrestricted access to their internals.
* Poltergeists - Objects whose sole purpose is to pass information to another object.
* Sequential coupling - A class that requires its method to be called in a particular order.
* Yo-yo problem - A structure that is hard to understand due to excessive fragmentation.
* Dependency hell - Problem with versions of required product.
* DLL hell - Inadequate management of dynamic linked libraries.

**Programming anti-patterns**

* Accidental complexity - Introducing unnecessary complexity into a solution.
* Action at distance - Unexpected interaction between widely separated parts of system.
* Blind faith - Lack of checking of correctness of a bug fix or result of a subroutine.
* Boat anchor - Retaining a part of a system that is no longer has any use.
* Busy spin - Consuming CPU while waiting for something to happen, usually by repeated checking rather than message passing.
* Caching failure - Forgetting to reset an error flag when an error has been corrected.
* Cargo cult programming - Using patterns and methods without understanding why.
* Coding by exception - Adding a new code to handle each special case as it is recognised.
* Error hiding - Catching an error message before it can be shown to the user, either showing nothing or showing a meaningless message.
* Hard code - Embedding assumption about environment of a system in its implementation.
* Lava flow - Retaining undesirable code because removing it is too expensive or has unpredictable consequences.
* Loop switch sequence - Encoding a set of sequential steps using a switch within a loop.
* Magic numbers - Including unexplained numbers in algorithm.
* Magic strings - Including literal strings in code, for comparison, as event types etc.
* Soft code - Storing business logic in configuration files rather than source code.
* Spaghetti code - Programs whose structure is barely comprehensible.

**Methodological anti-patterns**

* Copy-paste programming. Copying \(modifying\) and pasting existing code rather than implementing generic solution.
* Golden hammering - Assuming that a favourite solution is universally applicable.
* Improbability factor - Assuming that it is improbably that a known error will occur.
* NHI syndrome - The tendency towards reinventing the wheel, assuming it does not exist here before.
* Premature optimisation - Coding early on for a perceived efficiency, sacrificing good design, maintainability, and sometimes even real world efficiency.
* Programming by permutation - Trying to approach a solution by successively modifying the code to see if it works.
* Reinventing the wheel - Failing to adopt an existing, adequate solution.
* Reinventing the square wheel - Failing to adopt an existing solution and instead adopting a custom solution which performs much worse than an existing one.
* Silver bullet - Assuming that a favourite technical solution can solve a larger process or problem.
* Tester driven development - Projects in which new requirements are specified in bug reports.
